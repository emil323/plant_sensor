## Because plants can't text you when they're thirsty 🌱

Welcome to your new plant babysitter! This little gadget watches your plant's weight 24/7 and flashes an LED when it's time to water. No apps, no WiFi, no drama - just a smart light that speaks plant.

**What it does:** Learns your plant's weight when dry and wet, then alerts you when it's thirsty again.  
**Battery life:** Decades. Seriously. You'll probably move house before this needs a new battery.  
**Your job:** Press one button at the start, then water normally. That's it!

---

## Setup (Easier than assembling IKEA furniture)

### 1. Insert Battery & Power On
1. Pop in a charged 18650 battery (any protected Li-ion will do)
2. Mind the + and - markings (battery won't fit backwards anyway)
3. Press the **ON/OFF button**
4. LED breathes slowly? You're in business! 🎉

### 2. Put Plant On Scale
1. Find a flat, stable spot (wobbly tables need not apply)
2. Place your potted plant on the platform
3. Center it nicely - we're classy like that

### 3. The One-Time Calibration
**Wait!** Only do this when your plant is bone dry and sad. Timing is everything.

1. Let your plant dry out completely (you were going to water it today anyway, right?)
2. Press the **DRY button** once
3. LED flashes 3 times → "Got it, boss! Dry weight saved!" ✅
4. LED starts pulsing every 2 minutes → "Yep, still needs water!"

### 4. Water Your Plant (The Magic Part)
This is where it gets cool:

1. Water your plant however you want:
   - Dump it in from the top? Sure!
   - Slow trickle while you watch Netflix? Go ahead!
   - Bottom watering like a fancy plant parent? Absolutely!
   - Forget halfway through and come back later? Still works!

2. **Don't press anything.** The sensor is watching and will figure it out.

3. Wait 10-30 minutes for excess water to drain.

4. LED turns off → "All good here! See you in a week!" 😴

**That's it! You're done! The sensor now knows your plant and will alert you when it's thirsty again.**

## Daily Life (Spoiler: You Do Nothing)

Congratulations! You now have the world's most attentive plant sitter. Here's what happens next:

### When Everything is Fine 👍
- **LED: OFF** (silence is golden)
- Sensor: Checking weight once per day like a chill guardian
- You: Living your best life, not worrying about plants
- Battery: Slowly counting down from 40 years

### When Plant Gets Thirsty 💧
- **LED: Pulses once every 2 minutes** (gentle "hey, remember me?")
- Sensor: Now checking every 2 minutes (getting attentive)
- You: Water the plant whenever convenient
- Magic: Sensor detects the watering automatically! No button press!

### When You've Been Ghosting Your Plant 🚨
- **LED: Pulses TWICE every 2 minutes** (after 2 weeks of neglect)
- Translation: "HELLO?! IS ANYONE HOME?!"
- Recommended action: Water the plant, maybe apologize

### The Tech (For Curious Folks)
The sensor keeps a 60-minute memory of your plant's weight. When it sees a big jump (watering!), it waits for things to stabilize, then updates its brain. You water, it learns. Simple as that.

## LED Translation Guide (What's It Saying?)

| What You See | Translation | Your Move |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **3 slow breaths** | "I'm ready! Calibrate me!" | Press DRY button (when soil is dry) |
| **OFF** | "All good here! 😎" | Chill. Have some coffee. |
| **1 pulse** every 2 min | "Getting thirsty..." | Water the plant (your way) |
| **2 pulses** every 2 min | "SERIOUSLY THIRSTY! 😭" | Water now! It's been 2 weeks! |
| **3 quick flashes** | "Button press received!" | That's just confirmation |
| **3 slow pulses** | "Memory wiped. Fresh start!" | Start setup from beginning |
| **Dimmer than usual** | "Battery getting low..." | Check battery (still months left) |

**Fun fact:** All the fades are smooth and gentle. This sensor has class. No harsh blinking here!

---

## STATUS Button (The Plant Dashboard)

Press the **STATUS button** once for a complete readout. It's like checking your phone's battery... but for a plant.

### What Happens:

**Phase 1: Water Level** (3 seconds)
- LED fades up to show how much water is in the soil
- 💡 Bright = "Pool party in here!"
- 🕯️ Dim = "Getting parched..."
- ⚫ Off = "Desert vibes"

**Phase 2: Battery Level** (a few flashes)
- 4 flashes ⚡⚡⚡⚡ = 80-100% (fresh battery energy!)
- 3 flashes ⚡⚡⚡ = 50-80% (still going strong)
- 2 flashes ⚡⚡ = 30-50% (getting there... slowly)
- 1 flash ⚡ = 10-30% (might want to charge soon)
- Rapid flashing ⚡️⚡️⚡️ = <10% (charge within a few months)

**One press, full plant diagnostics. Doctors hate this simple trick!**

## When Things Get Weird (Troubleshooting)

### LED Won't Stop Breathing
**What's happening:** Not calibrated yet  
**Fix:** Wait for soil to dry completely, then press DRY button. (Did you skip the setup?)

---

### LED Won't Turn Off After Watering
**What's happening:** Sensor is waiting for things to settle  
**Fix:** 
- Give it 30 minutes for water to drain and soil to stabilize
- Don't jiggle the plant (sensor's trying to concentrate!)
- Make sure surface is stable and level
- Still going after 2 hours? Plant might need MORE water (some pots are sneaky)

---

### LED Never Alerts (Even When Bone Dry)
**What's happening:** Sensor doesn't know what "wet" means yet  
**Fix:**
- Water the plant REALLY thoroughly (see drainage? Good!)
- Wait 30 minutes for drainage to stop
- Sensor will detect the weight change and learn
- LED will shut up once it knows the wet weight

---

### Buttons Ignore You
**What's happening:** Battery issue or you're too gentle  
**Fix:**
- Check battery is in right way around (+ and -)
- Press buttons FIRMLY (they need confidence!)
- Hold for 1 full second
- STATUS button works but DRY doesn't? Press harder. These are physical buttons, not a touchscreen!

---

### Want a Fresh Start?
**Scenario:** Changed pots, moved plant, or just feeling chaotic  
**How to reset everything:**
1. Press and hold **BOTH buttons** together for 2 seconds
2. LED flashes 3 slow pulses → "Memory erased! Who am I?!"
3. Restart from calibration (press DRY when soil is dry)

## Battery & Maintenance (The Boring But Important Stuff)

### Battery Life: Ridiculously Long
- **Most houseplants** (watered weekly): ~40 years
- **Thirsty plants** (2×/week): ~27 years  
- **Succulents** (lazy watering): ~47 years
- **Why so long?** Device is asleep 96% of the time. It only wakes up to work when your plant is actually thirsty.

**Real talk:** The battery will probably outlast the electronics. Plan to swap it every 10-15 years just to be safe, not because it's dead.

### When to Charge/Replace
- LED dims to 50%? Battery <10%. Still have MONTHS left.
- Press STATUS button to see exact level (4 flashes = great, 1 flash = low)
- With 40-year life, you'll probably change it preemptively every decade

### What Battery to Use
**Unprotected 18650 Li-ion** (2000-2500mAh is plenty):
- **Samsung 25R** (2500mAh) - Great balance, ~23 years
- **LG HG2** (3000mAh) - High capacity option
- **Sony VTC6** (3000mAh) - Another good choice
- Button-top is easier to fit
- Standard Li-ion chemistry (3.0-4.2V)
- **Why unprotected?** The TP4056 charger module already has protection built-in! Protected cells just add a parasitic drain (10-50 µA) that cuts battery life in half.

### Charging
1. Plug in USB cable (any USB-C will do)
2. Red light? Charging. Green light? Done.
3. Leave plant on sensor while charging - nothing interrupts!

### Cleaning
- Wipe platform with damp cloth when it gets crusty
- Don't dunk the whole thing in water (electronics are allergic to pools)
- Clean regularly - soil buildup makes weight readings wonky

### Plant Growth is Automatic
Your plant will grow. The sensor knows this.
- As plant gets heavier, sensor updates its brain automatically
- No recalibration needed (unless you change pots)
- Max growth jump: 200g at once (that's one ambitious fern!)

| **Accuracy** | ±5g (pretty darn precise) |
| **Sleep power** | 5 µA (sips battery like fine wine) |
| **Check frequency (dry)** | Every 2 minutes (attentive) |
| **Check frequency (OK)** | Every 24 hours (chill) |
| **Operating voltage** | 3.0-4.2V (standard Li-ion) |

## Pro Tips (Speed Run to Plant Parent of the Year)

### ✅ DO These Things:
- Calibrate when soil is actually dry (damp doesn't count!)
- Put sensor on a stable, flat surface (wobbly tables are the enemy)
- Keep plant centered on the platform (balance is key)
- Water however you want - top, bottom, fast, slow, the sensor doesn't judge
- Clean the platform occasionally (crusty soil affects weight)

### ❌ DON'T Do These Things:
- Calibrate on wet soil (this confuses the sensor's tiny brain)
- Keep moving the plant around (it's trying to concentrate!)
- Bump or jostle the sensor (would you like being shaken while working?)
- Worry about watering methods (seriously, anything works)
- Expect instant updates (sensor waits for things to stabilize, like a patient scientist)

## Still Stuck?

If this manual didn't solve your problem:
1. Try the nuclear option: reset everything (both buttons, 2 seconds)
2. Recalibrate from scratch (sometimes a fresh start helps)
3. Check if battery is actually charged
4. Make sure surface is truly stable (not on a washing machine)
5. Verify you're not accidentally moving the plant

Still broken? Check the technical README or open a GitHub issue. Someone will help!

## The End 🌱

**Congrats! You now have a tireless plant babysitter.**

The sensor watches your plant 24/7 so you don't have to. When the LED pulses, water your plant. When it's quiet, live your life. 

May your plants be forever hydrated and your conscience forever clear.
