# Plant Sensor User Manual 🌱

**Your plant's new babysitter. LED pulses when thirsty. Battery lasts decades.**

## What's On Your Device

**Side 1:** 🔘 ON/OFF button | 🔌 USB-C charging port  
**Side 2:** 🔘 DRY button • 💡 LED • 🔘 STATUS button  
**Inside:** 🔋 18650 battery (2000-2500mAh unprotected recommended)

## Setup (3 Minutes)

**1. Power On**  
Insert charged 18650 battery → Press ON/OFF → LED breathes slowly = ready ✅

**2. Place Plant**  
Put plant on platform. Keep surface stable and level. Center plant.

**3. Calibrate (ONLY when soil is dry!)**  
Let plant dry completely → Press DRY button once → LED flashes 3× = saved ✅  
LED now pulses every 2 min = "needs water"

**4. Water Plant**  
Water however you want (top, bottom, fast, slow—all work!)  
**Don't press anything.** Wait 10-30 min for drainage.  
LED turns off automatically = done! 🎉

**The sensor learns wet weight automatically. You're done!**

## Daily Use

**LED OFF** = Plant happy. Sensor checks weight daily. You do nothing.  
**LED pulses 1×/2min** = Plant thirsty. Water when convenient. LED auto-stops after watering.  
**LED pulses 2×/2min** = Really thirsty (2+ weeks). Water soon!

## LED Meanings

| LED Pattern | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Slow breathing | Not calibrated | Press DRY when dry |
| OFF | All good | Nothing |
| 1 pulse/2min | Thirsty | Water plant |
| 2 pulses/2min | Very thirsty! | Water now |
| 3 quick flashes | Button confirmed | - |
| 3 slow pulses | Reset complete | Recalibrate |
| Dimmer than usual | Low battery | Charge soon |

## STATUS Button

**Press once for diagnostics:**

**Phase 1 (3 sec):** Water level  
• Bright = lots of water  
• Dim = low water  
• Off = dry

**Phase 2 (flashes):** Battery level  
• 4 flashes = 80-100%  
• 3 flashes = 50-80%  
• 2 flashes = 30-50%  
• 1 flash = 10-30%  
• Rapid = <10% (charge soon)

## Troubleshooting

**LED won't stop breathing**  
→ Not calibrated. Wait for dry soil, press DRY button.

**LED won't turn off after watering**  
→ Wait 30 min for drainage. Don't move plant. Still on? Might need more water.

**LED never alerts**  
→ Wet weight not learned. Water thoroughly until drainage, wait 30 min.

**Buttons don't work**  
→ Check battery polarity. Press HARD and hold 1 sec.

**Reset everything**  
→ Hold BOTH buttons 2 seconds → LED flashes 3× = memory cleared → Recalibrate.

## Battery & Care

**Battery Life:** 20-40 years typical (device sleeps 96% of time)

**Use unprotected 18650 cells** (2000-2500mAh):  
• Samsung 25R (2500mAh)  
• LG HG2 (3000mAh)  
• Sony VTC6 (3000mAh)

*Why unprotected?* TP4056 charger has protection. Protected cells waste 50% battery on parasitic drain.

**Charging:** Plug USB-C → Red light = charging → Green = done

**Cleaning:** Wipe platform with damp cloth. Don't submerge device.

**Plant growth:** Sensor auto-adjusts. No recalibration needed unless changing pots.

## Do's & Don'ts

**✅ DO:**  
• Calibrate on completely dry soil  
• Use stable, flat surface  
• Water however you like

**❌ DON'T:**  
• Calibrate on damp soil  
• Keep moving the plant  
• Jostle or bump sensor

**May your plants be forever hydrated!** The sensor watches 24/7. When LED pulses, water. When quiet, live your life. Battery probably outlives your plant. 🌱
